    "Throughout scientific computing and software engineering, processes are vectorised and there are regular matrix operations. This is also applicable to materials science and understanding matrix and tensor operations are essential to many different areas of engineering. Here, we will remind you have what matrix multiplication is and how it can be used, and the exercises will involve creating functions that do and visualise matrix transformations on objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "The exercise for this section follows on from the final part of Lecture 202. In this part we will generate a random set of particles, and then using this set of particles, calculate a function used in statistical mechanics as the radial distribution function, $g(r)$, which in two dimensios looks like this:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "g(r) = 2\\pi r \\rho (r)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "The mathematical definition can be considered daunting, but $g(r)$ has a simple meaning. It can be described as the probability of selecting any two particles in a system and for them to be a distance of $r$ apart. This translates into the following algorithm, for a set of particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each pair of particles in a system, calculate the distance between them and store it.\n",
    "2. Once all distances have been calculated, create a histogram of these distances\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate $g(r)$, we are going to quickly generate a 2D pseudo-FCC crystal structure and plot its $g(r)$. To do this, we will conduct the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate the particles in 2D using `numpy` and `scipy`\n",
    "2. Use `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist` to get the distances between the atoms\n",
    "3. Use `seaborn` to visualise the particles\n",
    "4. Use `numpy.histogram` to get a histogram of the distances\n",
    "5. Use `matplotlib` to plot the histogram which is essentially $g(r)$\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a 2D hexagonal close packed system of particles using cartesian co-ordinates. There are three things that are needed, the height between rows, the distance between particles in the same row and the offset between the first particle of an odd row, and the first particle of an even row. The distance between particles in the same row is the inter-particle distance, which we shall call $\\alpha$ (`alpha`), from which the other distances can be calculated. The height is given by the height of an equililateral triangle, $h=\\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}\\alpha$ and the offset is just half of $\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the distances, we can use `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist` (seen in Lecture 201) and use the direct result from that.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Extra part\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the first part, if you want a harder challenge try to do the following. First:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combine the $g(r)$ plot and particle visualisation in a set of two subplots\n",
    "2. Add an interactive slider that allows a user to change `alpha` and see in real time how $g(r)$ and the particles change\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you have more time, try this:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add a random displacement to all the particles in the system. This displacement should be extracted from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero, whereas the variance is an arbitrary input value. The displacement should be different (and independent) for each particle and each coordinate of the same particle. \n",
    "4. Repeat point 2 above but now make the variance the variable that can be changed instead of `alpha`. What do you observe? "
